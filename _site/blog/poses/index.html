  <p class="intro">
The rigid body assumption is a common simplification used to easily and quickly (with respect to computation) model rigid or even semi-rigid bodies. 
</p>

<h2 id="rigid-body-modeling">Rigid body modeling</h2>

<p>The rigid body assumption requires that, for any two points \(\mathbf{p}_1\) and \(\mathbf{p}_2\) on a rigid body, the distance between the two points remains constant for all time:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
||p_1 - p_2|| = c
\end{equation}</p>

<h3 id="kinematics">Kinematics</h3>

<p>Kinematics is the study of the position, velocity, acceleration, and further derivatives (including the third and fourth derivatives of position, jerk and snap, respectively) of bodies, which can include particles, rigid bodies, non-rigid bodies, fluids, etc.</p>

<p>We start with kinematics in two dimensions, which is easier to visualize and conceptualize than 3D. Assume that we are looking at 2D kinematics on the \(z = 0\) plane in 3D. When we look at angular motion in 2D, the axis of rotation will be the z-axis.</p>

<h3 id="kinematics-of-a-particle">Kinematics of a particle</h3>

<p>Presumably you already have knowledge of the very simple kinematics of a particle, which is a body that can be reasonably modeled as a point. We note the 
location of that particle with respect to some frame of reference as \(\mathbf{x}(t)\), where \(\mathbf{x}\) is a two-dimensional vector. The first time-derivative of position is the linear velocity and is written \(\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t)\). The second time-derivative of position is the linear acceleration and is written  \(\ddot{\mathbf{x}}(t)\).</p>

<h4 id="frame-of-reference-translation">Frame of reference (translation)</h4>

<p>Let’s immediately get into a seemingly cumbersome, but ultimately very useful habit of marking all relevant quantities with their reference frame. For example, assume that there does exist, somewhere in the universe, an absolute reference frame, which we’ll denote \(w\). We can then mark our
position vector and its derivatives as:</p>

<p>\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{q}_w(t), \dot{\mathbf{q}}_w(t), \ddot{\mathbf{q}}_w(t)
\end{equation}</p>

<p>which means that the position (and velocity and acceleration) of a point in
space is observed from \(w\). Now assume another reference frame, \(p\),
which has the same orientation as \(w\), but is located in a different place <em>that is a constant offset from \(\mathbf{q}_w\)</em>. We can then define \(\mathbf{q}_p = \mathbf{q}_w + \mathbf{v}_{\overrightarrow{qp}}\). Notice that velocity and acceleration do not change- \(\dot{\mathbf{q}}_p = \dot{\mathbf{q}}_w\) and \(\ddot{\mathbf{q}}_p = \ddot{\mathbf{q}}_w\)- because the vector from \(\mathbf{q}_w\) to frame \(p\) is constant.</p>

<p>

</table>
</p>

<h4 id="frame-of-reference-orientation">Frame of reference (orientation)</h4>

<p>Let’s now assume a new frame of reference, which we denote \(s\), and which is collocated with \(w\) but is rotated. If we assume that the first axis of \(w\) is named \(\mathbf{a}_x\) and the second axis is named \(\mathbf{a}_y\), we can similarly denote the first and second axes of \(s\) as \(\mathbf{a}’_x\) and \(\mathbf{a}’_y\). Since we are considering only two dimensions, each vector is two-dimensional. We can represent \(\mathbf{a}_x\) using the vector \(\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}^T\) and \(\mathbf{a}_y\) using the vector \(\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}^T\). We can transform vectors between the two reference frames using a matrix:</p>

<p>\begin{equation} 
\ _{w}\mathbf{R}_{s} \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{a}’_{x_1} &amp; \mathbf{a}’_{y_1} \\ \mathbf{a}’_{x_2} &amp; \mathbf{a}’_{y_2} \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>For example, try \(\mathbf{a}’_x \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}^T\) and \(\mathbf{a}’_y \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}-1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}^T\). This corresponds to the matrix:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}\ _{w}\mathbf{R}_{s} \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>These vectors should both be unit vectors and should be orthogonal, which makes this matrix an <em>orthogonal</em> matrix, giving it a determinant of \(\pm 1\). To keep everything consistent for our work, we henceforth require that the determinant always be equal to \(+1\).</p>

<p>We can set \(\ _{w}\mathbf{R}_{s}\) more simply using an angular rotation by \(\theta\) in the plane:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\ _{w}\mathbf{R}_{s} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos{\theta} &amp; -\sin{\theta} \\ \sin{\theta} &amp; \cos{\theta} \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>Given \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\), \(\ _{w}\mathbf{R}_{s}\) will be the matrix:
\begin{equation<em>}
\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; -1 \<br />
1 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation</em>}</p>

<p>The two frames \(s\) and \(w\) are depicted in the figure below.</p>

<p>
<table class="image">
<caption align="bottom">Depiction of two frames with collocated origins but different orientations.</caption>
<img src="../../assets/img/rotation-only.png" alt="Depiction of two frames with collocated origins but different orientations." width="400px" />
</table>
</p>

<p><em>You can make sense of the rotation matrix without knowing \(\theta\).</em> The first column of the matrix determines the direction of \(\mathbf{x}_s\) in \(w\)’s frame. The second column of the matrix determines the direction of \(\mathbf{y}_y\) in \(w\)’s frame. <strong>Make sure you understand this point before moving on.</strong></p>

<p>We now look at how we can transform position and its time derivatives between the reference frames. For our position vector in frame \(w\), we have:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}_{w} = \ _{w}\mathbf{R}_{s}\ \mathbf{x}_{s}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Here is where the subscripts for frame of reference start to come in handy. \(\ _{w}\mathbf{R}_{s}\) transforms from frame \(s\) to \(w\) (the convention is that the “source” frame is on the right hand side and the “target” frame is on the left). You can <strong>and should</strong> verify that all of the subscripts match up when moving from left to right.</p>

<p>Also, note that, due to the determinant of \(\ _{w}\mathbf{R}_{s}\) always being non-zero, the inverse of this matrix always exists. Indeed, we can get the transformation from \(w\) to \(s\) by inverting \(\ _{w}\mathbf{R}_{s}\): \({\ _{w}\mathbf{R}_{s}}^{-1} = \ _{s}\mathbf{R}_{w}\).</p>

<h4 id="translated-and-oriented-frame-of-reference">Translated and oriented frame of reference</h4>
<p>Combining translation and orientation for a frame of reference is straightforward using the individual elements of the previous two sections. We’ll denote our translated and oriented frame as \(s\), and note that it is oriented with respect to \(w\) (which we can specify using the matrix \(_w\mathbf{R}_s\) and vector \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{w}_o\mathbf{s}_o}\)- the subscript \(\ _o\) indicates the origin of a frame). We can then define a position vector in that frame as \(\mathbf{x}_s =\ _s\mathbf{R}_w \mathbf{x}_w + \overrightarrow{\mathbf{w}_o\mathbf{s}_o}\), using the position vector \(\mathbf{x}_w\) defined in the global frame.</p>

</p>

<h3 id="concatenated-transformations-and-homogeneous-transformation-matrices">Concatenated transformations and homogeneous transformation matrices</h3>
<p>For articulated characters, animals, robots, etc., it is convenient to
compute the position and orientation of each link as a sequence of operations. For example, in the diagram of a robot below, the second arm cover will move
when the first arm cover does.</p>

<p><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a4/63/9d/a4639d499d14aaedc7b6ce3637c1c301.jpg" alt="Diagram of a robot" /></p>

<p>Similarly, for the double link pendulum below, the endpoint (\(m_2\)) can
be found by- starting from the black circle- rotating by \(\theta_1\), then translating by \(l_1\), then rotating by \(\theta_2\), then finally translating by \(l_2\).</p>

<p><img src="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/dimg270.gif" alt="Depiction of a double pendulum" /></p>

<p>Performing this sequence of transformations is painful if we have to treat
rotation and translation separately, as in:
<script type="math/tex">\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{R}\mathbf{u}</script>
where \(\mathbf{r}\) is the vector describing translation and \(\mathbf{R}\) is a rotation matrix. If we combine two such transformations, we arrive at:
<script type="math/tex">\mathbf{p}' = \mathbf{r}' + \mathbf{R}'(\mathbf{r} + \mathbf{R}\mathbf{u})</script>
and three transformations appears even more cumbersome:
<script type="math/tex">\mathbf{p}'' = \mathbf{r}'' + \mathbf{R}''(\mathbf{r}' + \mathbf{R}'(\mathbf{r} + \mathbf{R}\mathbf{u}))</script></p>

<p>The problem is that rotation is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map">linear transformation</a> while translation is not. However, we can turn translation into a linear transformation, which allows us to replace the cumbersome series of operations above with simply matrix multiplications, resulting in an equation that looks like this:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{p}’’ = \mathbf{T}’’ \cdot \mathbf{T}’ \cdot \mathbf{T} \cdot \mathbf{p}
\label{eqn:sequence}
\end{equation}
This is easier to look at, use, and debug than the previous sequence of operations.</p>

<h4 id="homogeneous-coordinates">Homogeneous coordinates</h4>
<p>The key is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates">homogeneous coordinates</a>. For example, the Cartesian coordinates:
<script type="math/tex">\begin{bmatrix}
x \\\\
y 
\end{bmatrix}</script>
become
<script type="math/tex">\begin{bmatrix}
x \\\\
y \\\\
1
\end{bmatrix}</script></p>

<p>The form of the \(\mathbf{T}\) matrices above is now \(3 \times 3\) and represents a two-dimensional rotation about \(\theta\) <em>followed by</em> a translation by \((t_x,t_y)\):
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos{\theta} &amp; -\sin{\theta} &amp; t_x \<br />
\sin{\theta} &amp; \cos{\theta} &amp; t_y \<br />
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
\label{eqn:homogeneous}
\end{equation}</p>

<p><strong>Exercise: Apply the homogeneous transformation \(\theta = \pi, t_x = 1, t_y = 1\) to \(\mathbf{p} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}^{\mathsf{T}}\). Is the result what you expected?</strong></p>

<p>Another way to write this matrix is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_matrix">block form</a>:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\mathbf{T} \equiv
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{R} &amp; \mathbf{t} \<br />
\mathbf{0} &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
\label{eqn:homogeneous2}
\end{align}</p>

<p>where \(\mathbf{R}\) is the \(2 \times 2\) rotation matrix and \(\mathbf{t}\) is the \(2 \times 1\) translation vector.</p>

<h4 id="inverting-transformations">Inverting transformations</h4>

<p>One of the great things about a rotation matrix is that its orthogonality makes it <a href="../linear-algebra">easy and fast to invert</a>. Unfortunately, a homogeneous transformation matrix is not orthogonal. However, we can still invert the matrix easily using the following formula:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{T}^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{R}^\mathsf{T} &amp; -\mathbf{R}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{t} \<br />
\mathbf{0} &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}</p>

<h4 id="transforming-points-vs-transforming-vectors">Transforming points vs. transforming vectors</h4>

<p>When we transform points (as might compose vertices in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope">polytopic shapes</a>), the Euclidean norm of those points may
change. When we transform vectors (as might describe the angular velocity
of a body), <em>we wish to preserve lengths</em>. Consider the figure above where
\(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\). The homogeneous transformation matrix corresponding to this figure is:
\begin{equation<em>}
\ _w\mathbf{T}_s \equiv 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 \<br />
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \<br />
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation</em>}</p>

<p>If we define the vector \(\mathbf{v}_s \equiv \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}^{\mathsf{T}}\), then:
\begin{equation<em>}
\ _w\mathbf{T}_s \mathbf{v}_s = \mathbf{v}_w = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation</em>}
and we notice that the lengths of the two vectors are not equal (ignoring the homogeneous components of course): \(||\mathbf{v}_s|| = \sqrt{2} \neq 2 = ||\mathbf{v}_w||\). If we want to preserve magnitudes, we only apply the rotational part of the matrix:
\begin{equation<em>}
\ _w\mathbf{R}_s \equiv
\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; -1 \<br />
1 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation</em>}
Then \(||\ _w\mathbf{R}_s \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}^{\mathsf{T}}|| = ||\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}^{\mathsf{T}}||\).</p>

<h4 id="concatenating-transformations">Concatenating transformations</h4>

<p>A sequence of transformations, as might be used for determining the poses
of the links of a robot arm, is applied from right to left: in Equation \ref{eqn:sequence}, \(\mathbf{T}\) is applied first, then \(\mathbf{T}’\), and
finally \(\mathbf{T}’’\). Difficulty remembering the ordering- and the ordering changes if moving from the form of the homogeneous transformation in Equation \ref{eqn:homogeneous} to an OpenGL-style homogeneous transformation!- is one
reason we mark the frame of reference for transformations.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> This example shows how we can determine the location of any point on a multi-rigid body or the pose defined with respect to a link on a multi-rigid body using a sequence of transformations. See the depiction of a pendulum below.</p>

<p>
<table class="image">
<caption align="bottom">Depiction of frames and variables used to describe the kinematics of a single pendulum.</caption>
<img src="../../assets/img/pendulum-frames.png" alt="Depiction of frames and variables used to describe the kinematics of a single pendulum." width="400px" />
</table>
</p>

<p>The transformation from Frame 1 (defined at the endpoint of the pendulum) to Frame 0 (the world frame) is determined like so:</p>

<p>\begin{equation<em>}
\ _0\mathbf{T}_1 = \ _0\mathbf{T}_{0’} \cdot \ _{0’}\mathbf{T}_1
\end{equation</em>}</p>

<p>where</p>

<p>\begin{equation<em>}
_0\mathbf{T}_{0’} \equiv
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos{\theta} &amp; -\sin{\theta} &amp; 0 \<br />
\sin{\theta} &amp; \cos{\theta} &amp; 0 \<br />
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation</em>}
and
\begin{equation<em>}
_{0’}\mathbf{T}_{1} \equiv
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \<br />
0 &amp; 1 &amp; -\ell \<br />
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation</em>}</p>

<p><strong>Make sure you understand why the \(\ell\) in \(\ _{0’}\mathbf{T}_1\)
is translated along -y</strong>.</p>

<p>Given the relationship \(\ _0\mathbf{T}_1\), we can transform points from Frame 1 to Frame 0. For instance, if I want to know the position of the pendulum bob in the world frame, I can do this:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\mathbf{p}_1 &amp; \equiv \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \<br />
\mathbf{p}_0 &amp; = \ _0\mathbf{T}_1 \cdot \mathbf{p}_1
\end{align}</p>

<p><em>You should try this yourself using simple values for \(\theta\) and \(\ell\)</em> (like \(pi\) and \(1\), respectively). You should also practice
converting from points in Frame 0 back to Frame 1.</p>

<h3 id="rigid-body-kinematics">Rigid body kinematics</h3>
<p>Modeling particles doesn’t require consideration of orientation because particles are infinitesimally small. When bodies have significant dimensions, they can not be modeled as particles and we must move along the spectrum of modeling complexity. If the body can effectively be modeled as rigid, we can completely specify the body’s configuration using only a reference point on the body (often we use the center-of-mass) and the body’s orientation. As we’re still working in only two-dimensions, that means each body’s configuration can be specified using some number of (minimally three) real numbers, termed the <em>generalized coordinates</em>. The time-derivatives of the generalized coordinates are termed the <em>generalized velocities</em>. Generalized coordinates and velocities are always defined with respect to a frame of reference.</p>

<h4 id="generalized-coordinates-in-the-global-reference-frame">Generalized coordinates in the global reference frame</h4>
<p>Let’s first look at the generalized coordinates for a body defined in the global reference frame, \(w\):</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\mathbf{q}_w = \begin{bmatrix} \bar{x}_w \\ \bar{y}_w \\ \theta_w \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>where \({ \bar{x}_w, \bar{y}_w }\) is the position of the center-of-mass in frame \(w\).</p>

<h4 id="generalized-velocities-in-the-global-reference-frame">Generalized velocities in the global reference frame</h4>
<p>Let’s now compute the time-derivatives:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\dot{\mathbf{q}}_w = \begin{bmatrix} \dot{\bar{x}}_w \\ \dot{\bar{y}}_w \\ \dot{\theta}_w \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>This is just the velocity of the body at its center-of-mass (the <em>linear velocity</em>) and its rate of angular rotation (the <em>angular velocity</em>).</p>

<h3 id="velocity-of-a-point-on-a-rigid-body">Velocity of a point on a rigid body</h3>
<p>How do the kinematic equations change if the generalized coordinates are defined with respect to a point on the rigid body, rather than with respect to the body’s center-of-mass? First of all, we have to define our point such that we can always identify it! Let us call this point of interest \(\mathbf{p}\) and define it in Frame \(w\) as follows:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\mathbf{p}_w = \begin{bmatrix}\bar{x}_w \\ \bar{y}_w \end{bmatrix} + \ _w\mathbf{R}_i(\theta_w)\cdot \mathbf{r}_i
\end{equation}</p>

<p>where \(\ _w\mathbf{R}_i\) is the matrix encoding the orientation of the body and \(\mathbf{r}_i\) is a vector from the center-of-mass to the point on the body <em>in the body frame</em>, which we denote as \(i\): since this vector is defined in the body frame, \(\mathbf{r}\) does not change as the body moves or rotates.</p>

<p>We can then derive \(\dot{\mathbf{p}}_w\):
\begin{equation}
\dot{\mathbf{p}}_w = \begin{bmatrix}\dot{\bar{x}}_w \\ \dot{\bar{y}}_w \end{bmatrix} + \ _w\dot{\mathbf{R}}_i(\theta_w, \dot{\theta}_w)\cdot \mathbf{r}_i
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\ _w\dot{\mathbf{R}}_i \equiv
\dot{\theta}_w 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos{(\theta_w + \frac{\pi}{2})} &amp; -\sin{(\theta_w + \frac{\pi}{2})} \<br />
\sin{(\theta_w + \frac{\pi}{2})} &amp; \cos{(\theta_w + \frac{\pi}{2})}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}</p>

<p><em>Problem:</em> Derive this identity for the time derivative of a rotation matrix
using derivative calculus and trigonometric identities.</p>
