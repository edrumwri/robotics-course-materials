  <p>The <em>equations of motion</em>- that transform forces applied to a robot into motion- represent a <em>dynamical system</em>, a mathematical concept. Knowledge of 
dynamical systems allows robots to predict how a thrown ball will move and
to pick footsteps to prevent falling over, among other uses.</p>

<h2 id="dynamical-systems">Dynamical systems</h2>

<p>Let us start by defining the <em>state</em> of a dynamical system. The state is
typically denoted with the variable \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n\) and
may represent position, orientation, temperature, pressure, force, current, etc. 
<em>Time \(t\) and state of the dynamical
system at \(t\)</em> must be sufficient to predict the state of the dynamical system at some time in the future. For example, let us assume that we know all of the forces acting on the moon Europa, that Europa is well modeled as a point mass, and that we have an accurate estimate of Europa’s mass. Given this information and the current location of Europa, we still cannot predict Europa’s location a year into the future: we also need
Europa’s current velocity. In summary, if we treat Europa as a dynamical system- and planetary objects were the first objects of study in dynamical systems- then its state should consist (at least) of its position and velocity.</p>

<p>The path that the state takes over time is known as its <em>trajectory</em> or 
<em>orbit</em>.</p>

<p>

<h3 id="evolution-of-a-dynamical-system">Evolution of a dynamical system</h3>

<p>Another key attribute of a dynamical system is that it should have an update
or transition rule. This rule may be deterministic or stochastic (probabilistic or nondeterministic)- if the former, we can <em>accurately predict the state of
a dynamical system at a specified time into the future given only its state
at the current time</em>. An interesting example of the latter is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">N-armed bandit</a>. Stochastic dynamical systems are effectively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov Chains</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous-time_Markov_chain">Markov Processes</a>, for those readers familiar with stochastic processes. The remainder of this learning module will discuss only deterministic
dynamical systems.</p>

<p>Dynamical systems can also be discrete, meaning that they update discontinuously (the rule is then a <em>transition rule</em>). Alternatively, the system is continuous, which means that the dynamical system is continuous (and generally smooth). Some systems are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_system">really a mix of the two</a>, but we will not consider these hybrid systems further.</p>

<p>If the dynamical system is discrete, the transition rule is represented by a <em>difference equation</em>, shown in an example below:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\mathbf{x}_{i+1} = f(\mathbf{x}_i)
\end{align}</p>

<p>Notice that the next state of \(\mathbf{x}\) is completely a function of the
current state and that the transition is immediate (discontinuous).</p>

<p>If the dynamical system is continuous, the update rule is represented by a 
(ordinary) <em>differential equation</em>:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f(\mathbf{x}, t)
\end{align}</p>

<p>The dot notation \(\dot{\mathbf{x}}\) is a synonym for \(\textrm{d}\mathbf{x}/\textrm{d}t\).</p>

<p>We will only consider ordinary differential equations (ODEs), as opposed to differential equations that include partial derivatives, known as partial
differential equations (PDEs). The remainder of this learning module will
also consider only differential equations- difference equations will not be
discussed further.</p>

<h3 id="digression-mathematical-notation">Digression: mathematical notation</h3>

<p>For this learning module and all others, I will denote scalar real numbers using lowercase type (like \(s \in \mathbb{R}\)), vectors in boldface lowercase type (like \(\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n\)), matrices in boldface uppercase type (like \(\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\)).</p>

<p>Functions will be typeset in lowercase type, as in \(f(.)\), and will
be typeset in boldface type if they return a vector output, as in \(\mathbf{g} \to \mathbb{R}^m\).</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-dynamical-system-the-lorenz-equations">A simple dynamical system: the Lorenz Equations</h2>
<p>A well-studied dynamical system was described by Lorenz for modeling climate. 
His dynamical system is a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory">chaotic system</a>, which- like the weather- is highly sensitive to initial conditions. Lorenz’s work spawned the thought that a
butterfly’s wings flapping in Texas might be able to set off a tornado in 
Brazil.</p>

<p>The Lorenz equations follow:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = \sigma(y - x) \<br />
\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = x(\rho - z) - y \<br />
\frac{dz}{dt} &amp; = xy - \beta z 
\end{align}</p>

<p>where the system state is determined using variables \((x, y, z)\), \(t\) is time, and \(\sigma \textrm{ (sigma)}, \rho \textrm{ (rho)}, \textrm{ and } \beta \textrm{ (beta)}\) are constant parameters.</p>

<p>The Lorenz equations are plotted below using some unknown initial values and unknown \(t\):</p>

</p>

<h3 id="plotting-the-lorenz-system-using-octavematlab">Plotting the Lorenz system using Octave/Matlab</h3>

<p>I will now show how to use GNU Octave and Matlab to integrate the Lorenz equations
numerically.</p>

<p>First, we set the initial conditions of x, y, and z in Matlab/Octave to x=1, y=1, z=1. We will label all variables \(\mathbf{x}\) to use Octave/Matlab vector notation.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; % set the initial conditions
&gt;&gt; x0 = [ 1 1 1 ]';
</code></pre>

<p><strong>In Matlab</strong>:</p>

<p>Create the file <code>lorenz.m</code> and save it in your current directory.
The contents of this file should be:</p>

<pre><code>function dxdt = lorenz(t, x)

  % set values for rho, sigma, and beta
  rho = 28;
  sigma = 10;
  beta = 8/3;

  % setup the right hand side of the ordinary differential equation 
  dxdt(1,1) = sigma*(x(2) - x(1));
  dxdt(2,1) = x(1)*(rho - x(3)) - x(2);
  dxdt(3,1) = x(1)*x(2) - beta*x(3);
</code></pre>

<p>At the Matlab prompt (“»”) run the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>  &gt;&gt; t = 0:1e-2:20;
  &gt;&gt; [tout, x] = ode45(@lorenz, t, x0);
  &gt;&gt; plot3(x(:,1), x(:,2), x(:,3));
</code></pre>

<p><strong>In GNU/Octave</strong>, the file <code>lorenz.m</code> should look almost exactly the same- the arguments <code>t</code> and <code>x</code> to the <code>lorenz</code> function are swapped. The file is otherwise identical:</p>

<pre><code>function dxdt = lorenz(x, t)

  % set values for rho, sigma, and beta
  rho = 28;
  sigma = 10;
  beta = 8/3;

  % setup the right hand side of the ordinary differential equation 
  dxdt(1,1) = sigma*(x(2) - x(1));
  dxdt(2,1) = x(1)*(rho - x(3)) - x(2);
  dxdt(3,1) = x(1)*x(2) - beta*x(3);
</code></pre>

<p>At the Octave prompt (“octave:n&gt;”) run the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>  octave:1&gt; t = 0:1e-2:20;
  octave:2&gt; x = lsode(@lorenz, x0, t);
  octave:3&gt; plot3(x(:,1), x(:,2), x(:,3));
</code></pre>

<h2 id="solving-odes">Solving ODEs</h2>

<p>“Solving an ordinary differential equation” indicates solving the initial value problem in closed form. 
In other words, given initial conditions, what is the state at some time in the future? As an example, consider one ODE:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\dot{x} = -10x
\end{equation}</p>

<p>The solution to this ODE is:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
x(t) = Ce^{-10t}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>where \(C\) is an unknown constant. When we are given \(x(0)\), then we
can solve algebraically for \(C\).</p>

<h4 id="wait-cant-we-just-use-the-anti-derivative-integrals">Wait, can’t we just use the anti-derivative? (integrals?)</h4>

<p>The anti-derivative is usable to solve <em>separable</em> differential equations,
like:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\frac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x} = 6y^2x
\end{equation}</p>

<p>All \(y\) and \(x\) variables simply need to be on different sides of the
equation to use anti-derivatives:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\int \frac{\textrm{d}y}{y^2} &amp; = \int 6x\ \textrm{d}x \<br />
\frac{-1}{y} + C &amp; = 3x^2 
\end{align}</p>

<p>Now consider the ordinary differential equation below:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\frac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x} + xy = x^2 
\end{equation}</p>

<p>See whether you can find a way to separate it as above.</p>

<p>A course on ODEs teaches you to solve initial value problems for 
ordinary differential equations (particularly inseparable ODEs like that above), in closed form. In robotics, our ODEs are
often unknown or too complex to compute closed form solutions for. We 
generally focus on <em>numerical</em> solutions to ODEs.</p>

<h3 id="solving-odes-numerically">Solving ODEs numerically</h3>

<p>When initial value problems for ODEs cannot be solved in closed form, they must be solved numerically. This section discusses doing just that.</p>

</p>

<p>The ordinary differential equation of motion for the pendulum is:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\ddot{\theta} + g/L \sin \theta = 0
\end{equation}</p>

<p>where \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity, \(L\) is the length of the rod, and \(\theta\) is the angular displacement. The pendulum is a classical dynamical system and deriving its ordinary differential equation is a seminal task in courses on ordinary differential equations and classical mechanics.</p>

<p><em>The pendulum is an essential component of many seminal dynamic tasks
in control theory, including the <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~rsmith/MA731_S09/Astrom_Furuta.pdf">pendulum swing-up task</a> and the <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6313077&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6313077">cart-pole balancing problem</a>.</em> <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=973365&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D973365">The cart-pole 
balancing problem has been effectively used as a balancing model for

<h4 id="canonical-system-of-first-order-odes">Canonical system of first order ODEs</h4>
<p>Most algorithms for numerically integrating ordinary differential equations
require that the ODEs be first order, where the <em>order</em> of an ODE is the highest derivative in the equation. This problem is readily solved using variable substitution, as seen applied to the second order ODE for the pendulum below:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\dot{\theta} &amp; = \vartheta \<br />
\dot{\vartheta} + g/L \sin \theta &amp; = 0 \label{eqn:varphi}
\end{align}</p>

<h4 id="eulers-method-for-integrating-odes">Euler’s Method for integrating ODEs</h4>

<p>Euler’s Method for integrating ODEs is best derived using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor%27s_theorem">Taylor’s theorem</a> for approximating a function in a particular neighborhood using an infinite polynomial sum. However, I’ll cover Euler’s Method using the limit definition of the derivative instead. Recall:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\frac{\textrm{d}x}{dt} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{x(t+\Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Thus, for sufficiently small \(\Delta t\), we have:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\frac{\textrm{d}x}{\textrm{d}t} = \frac{x(t+\Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>and after just a little algebraic manipulation:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
x(t+\Delta t) = x(t) + \Delta t \frac{\textrm{d}x}{\textrm{d}t}
\end{equation}</p>

<p><em>This formula is the basis for an algorithm</em>. Use the current value of \(x\) and the current derivative, which is itself a function of the current value of \(x\), to compute the next value of \(x\). For the simplest version of this
algorithm, \(\Delta t\) is constant.</p>

<h4 id="integrating-the-pendulum-using-eulers-method">Integrating the pendulum using Euler’s Method</h4>

<p>To numerically integrate the pendulum’s equations of motion using initial
conditions \(\theta = \pi/2, \vartheta = \dot{\theta} = 0\), we take
the following steps, <em>valid for both Matlab and GNU/Octave.</em></p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Setup the ODE function.</p>

<pre><code>function dxdt = pendulum(x)

  % setup gravity and pendulum rod length
  g = 9.8;
  L = 1;

  % setup theta and dtheta/dt
  theta = x(1);
  dtheta = x(2);

  % compute the ODE
  dxdt(1) = dtheta;
  dxdt(2) = -g/L * sin(theta);
</code></pre>

<p>In contrast to <code>lorenz</code>, <code>pendulum</code> does not accept \(t\)
as a formal parameter, because the ODE is not explicitly dependent upon \(t\).</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Setup the initial conditions at the Matlab/Octave command prompt.</p>

<pre><code>  &gt;&gt; x(1,:) = [pi/2 0];
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Pick the integration step size. I use all caps in my programming code to denote constants. We’ll want to explore the effect of varying this value.</p>

<pre><code>  &gt;&gt; DT = .01;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Pick the time interval to integrate over. Because the pendulum is a periodic dynamical system, I want the time interval to be sufficiently large to observe the periodic motion.</p>

<pre><code>  &gt;&gt; TEND = 10;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Perform the Euler integration.</p>

<pre><code>  &gt;&gt; for t=DT:DT:TEND  % integrate for 10 seconds
  i = size(x,1); % get the last state index
  dxdt = pendulum(x(i,:)); % evaluate the ODE using current x 
  x(i+1,:) = x(i,:) + dxdt*DT; % integrate state forward 
  end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Plot the joint angle of the pendulum over time.</p>

<pre><code>  &gt;&gt; plot(0:DT:tend, x(:,1));
</code></pre>

<h2 id="stability-of-a-dynamical-system">Stability of a dynamical system</h2>

<p>If the state of a dynamical system is two dimensional, we can readily
visualize the change in state using arrow depictions. Examine some 
visualizations of dynamical systems below carefully.</p>

<p>The dynamical system below can be seen to drive the state to \(\mathbf{x}=0,0\). This point is known as a <em>equilibrium point</em> or a <em>fixed point</em>.</p>

<p><em>Definition of an equilibrium point / fixed point</em>:</p>

<p><strong>A state \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is an equilibrium point if \(\mathbf{f(x)} = \mathbf{0}\), where \(\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}, t)\).</strong></p>

<p>The dynamical system below is <em>stable</em> in the region that we are viewing: if the
system enters this region, the state will eventually end up at the equilibrium
point. This concept is important in airplanes. If the pilot puts the plane into a dive
and then removes her hands from the yoke, the plane will return to level
flight after a short time. <em>This concept is important in robotics for the same reason</em>:
a robot will ideally “go to rest” if no controls are applied to it for some
time.</p>

<p>The dynamical system below depicts many fixed points (where arrows are
missing). Two regions of such fixed points are stable: the left and upper
right vortices. Equilibrium points in other regions are not stable because,
if sufficiently far from the region, the state can get swept into one of the 
two vortices.</p>

<h3 id="determining-whether-a-dynamical-system-is-stable-around-a-fixed-point">Determining whether a dynamical system is stable around a fixed point</h3>

<p>Determining stability in the neighborhood of an equilibrium point is
mostly beyond the scope of this learning module. I will cover a few key concepts, however.</p>

<h4 id="stability-type">Stability type</h4>

<p>Stability considers the neighborhood of states around an equilibrium point.</p>

<p>The following types of stability are listed in decreasing order from the
strongest sense of stability to the weakest.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Exponential stability</strong>: neighboring states converge exponentially fast to the fixed point</li>
  <li><strong>Asymptotic stability</strong>: neighboring states eventually converge to the fixed point</li>
  <li><strong>Lyapunov stability</strong>: neighboring states stay within a small neighborhood</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="methods-for-determining-stability">Methods for determining stability</h4>

<p>Without going too far into stability analysis of dynamical systems, I will
quickly describe two methods for analyzing stability.</p>

<h5 id="linearization">Linearization</h5>

<p>A linear dynamical system can be expressed in the form:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>where \(\mathbf{A}\) is a matrix. If the dynamical system is linear or
it can effectively be approximated by a linear dynamical system in the 
neighborhood of an equilibrium point, we can analyze the eigenvalues of \(\mathbf{A}\). Unless \(\mathbf{A}\) is a symmetric matrix, it will have 
both real and imaginary eigenvalues.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the real components of all eigenvalues are negative, the linear system is asymptotically stable</li>
  <li>If all real components of all eigenvalues are non-positive, the linear system is marginally stable</li>
  <li>If there exists a positive real eigenvalue, the linear system is unstable around the equilibrium point</li>
</ul>

<p>Within the realm of stable systems, a system is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Underdamped</strong> if the system oscillates about equilibrium with oscillations gradually decreasing in amplitude until finally reaching zero. A system is underdamped if the eigenvalues have complex components (but the real components are necessarily non-positive).</li>
  <li><strong>Overdamped</strong> if the system exponentially decays to equilibrium without oscillating. A system is overdamped if the eigenvalues are real and unequal (and are negative).</li>
  <li><strong>Critically damped</strong> if the system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating. A system is underdamped if all eigenvalues are real and equal (and negative).</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p><strong>An example:</strong> Consider the pendulum that we integrated above. Let us
first look for equilibrium points. Equilibrium points for the pendulum exist where \(\dot{\theta} = 0, \dot{\varphi} = 0\). \(\dot{\theta} = 0\) when the velocity of the pendulum is zero,
so that part is easy. We next solve Equation \ref{eqn:varphi} for \(\dot{\varphi} = 0\):
\begin{align}
\dot{\varphi} &amp; = -g/L \sin \theta \<br />
0 &amp; = -g/L \sin \theta
\end{align}
\(\sin \theta\) is zero for \(\theta = \{ 0, \pi \}\). Therefore, the
pendulum has two equilibrium points: \({\theta = 0, \dot{\theta} = 0}\) and \({\theta=\pi, \dot{\theta} = 0} \).</p>

<p>The pendulum is nonlinear
because of the presence of the \(\sin\) term, which means that it seems that we can’t express it in the form \(\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{Ax}\). However,
if we notice that \(\sin \theta \approx \theta\) for \(\theta \approx 0\) and \(\sin \theta \approx \pi - \theta\) for \(\theta \approx \pi\), then
we can get a <em>linearization</em> for \(\dot{\varphi}\):
\begin{equation}
\dot{\varphi} \approx \begin{cases} -g/L\ \theta &amp; \textrm{ if } \theta \approx 0 \<br />
-g/L\ (\pi - \theta) &amp; \textrm{ if } \theta \approx \pi \end{cases}
\end{equation}</p>

<p><strong>What is \(\mathbf{A}\) in this case?</strong></p>

<p>We need to be able to put the equations in the form:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
\dot{\theta} \<br />
\dot{\varphi}
\end{bmatrix} =
\mathbf{A}
\begin{bmatrix}
\theta \<br />
\varphi
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>This means \(\mathbf{A}\) can take two forms, depending on which equilibrium point we are using:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\mathbf{A}_0 &amp; = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 &amp; 1 \<br />
-g/L &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}\<br />
\mathbf{A}_\pi &amp; = \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 \<br />
g/L &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix} 
\end{align}</p>

<p><em>Note that to get \(\mathbf{A}_\pi\) we must make the variable substitution: \(\theta^* = \theta + \pi\) to put the equations in the form \(\dot{\mathbf{ x}} = \mathbf{Ax}\). This substitution need not be considered further in
the stability analysis.</em></p>

<p><strong>Examining the eigenvalues:</strong></p>

<p>In the case of \(\mathbf{A}_0\), positive \(g\) and \(L\) yields
eigenvalues of \(0 \pm xi \), where \(x\) is an imaginary scalar. In the 
case of
\(\mathbf{A}\_\pi\), positive \(g\) and \(L\) yields eigenvalues of
\(\pm y\), where \(y\) is a real scalar.</p>

<p>We can see this using Matlab or Octave:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; g = 9.8;
&gt;&gt; L = 1.0;
&gt;&gt; A = [0 1; -g/L 0]; % first equilibrium point
&gt;&gt; eig(A)

ans =
       0 + 3.1305i
       0 - 3.1305i

&gt;&gt; A = [0 1; g/L 0];  % second equilibrium point
&gt;&gt; eig(A)

ans =

       3.1305
      -3.1305
</code></pre>

<p><em>Deeper questions</em>: what do the eigenvalues for \(\mathbf{A}_0\) and 
\(\mathbf{A}_\pi\) indicate about stability? Now think about the configuration of the pendulum at the two equilibrium points. Does the stability analysis 
make sense when examining these two configurations?</p>

<h5 id="lyapunov-functions">Lyapunov functions</h5>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_function">Lyapunov functions</a> are the
go to approach for proving stability of <em>nonlinear</em> dynamical systems.</p>

<p>Wikipedia’s informal description of Lyapunov functions is accessible: “a Lyapunov function is a function that takes positive values everywhere except at any stasis in question, and decreases (or is non-increasing) along every trajectory of the ODE”. If a Lyapunov
function can be found for an equilibrium point of a dynamical system, the
system is Lyapunov stable in the neighborhood of that point. Finding a
Lyapunov function for an arbitrary ODE is currently an open problem.</p>
