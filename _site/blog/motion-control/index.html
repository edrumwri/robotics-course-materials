  <p>This learning module focuses on approaches for regulating the <em>motion</em> of a 
robot. Concepts covered include model-based (feedforward) and model-free (error feedback) approaches, composite approaches, and stability.</p>

<p>A caveat: even if we could control the motion of a robot with perfect accuracy
does not mean that it’s a good idea. A robot that moves exactly as commanded, minimizing 
the effects of all disturbances on its motion, is a robot that will crush
humans, damage the environment, or destroy itself. To avoid those problems, 
one should consider alternative schemes like <a href="http://users.softlab.ntua.gr/~ktzaf/Courses/literature/07_Force_Control.pdf">force control</a>, which regulates
the force applied to the environment, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impedance_control">impedance control</a>, which regulates 
the relationship between force and motion. Such schemes should be 
considered for uncontrolled environments or when the accuracy necessary
to perform a task is higher than the accuracy of motion and/or modeling.</p>

<p>Some definitions of basic concepts in control:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Controller</strong>: sends inputs to the dynamical system that may change its state</li>
  <li><strong>Plant</strong>: another name for the dynamical system that the controller can change</li>
  <li><strong>Reference signal</strong>: the value (state or a function of state) that the system is to attain. The reference signal may be fixed (a thermostat setting is effectively fixed) or changing over time</li>
  <li><strong>Error signal</strong>: the difference between the reference signal and the system’s output</li>
</ul>

<p>An example that we will use for illustrative purposes is a cruise control
system in a car. In this example, the car is the plant, the cruise control
is the controller, the driver’s set speed is the reference signal, and the
control input is the throttle (the gas pedal).</p>

<h2 id="inverse-dynamics-control">Inverse dynamics control</h2>

<p>Without loss of generality, let’s consider the <em>linear</em> dynamical system:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{B}\mathbf{u}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>where \(\mathbf{u}\) are the controls that we can apply. Assume
that \(\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) and that
\(\mathbf{B}\) is a full rank matrix. Then if we want to determine
controls \(\mathbf{u}\) to drive the system to change in state \(\dot{\mathbf{x}}_{\textrm{des}}\), algebra yields:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{B}^{-1}(\dot{\mathbf{x}}_{\textrm{des}} - \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x})
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Controlling a dynamical system in this way is termed <em>inverse dynamics 
control</em>. This is straightforward- so why is this a full learning module?</p>

<ul>
  <li>The control system designer may not possess a mathematical model (\(\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{Bu}\) in the case above) of the dynamical system, so alternative control techniques may be necessary. With respect to robotics, obtaining accurate and rapidly computable mathematical models of robots with compliant elements is challenging.</li>
  <li><em>A mathematical model is just a model</em>. There will usually be 
effects- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlash_(engineering)">transmission backlash</a>, imperfectly rigid links, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-electromotive_force">counter-electromotive forces</a>, joint friction, and other
influences- that the model will not account for, so the inverse dynamics 
control will generally not influence the system exactly as desired. Some form
of error feedback control is usually necessary as well.</li>
  <li>In tandem with the previous point, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_identification">system identification</a> is necessary to identify modeling parameters. For example, if our dynamics model incorporates Coulomb and viscous friction models at the joints, then both Coulomb and viscous friction parameters must be determined. Determining these parameters is often a tedious process that requires extensive physical experimentation and can change as the robot is operated (as it enters its normal operating temperature, leaks hydraulic fluid, etc.) or manipulates or carries objects.</li>
  <li>Even if we possess a perfect mathematical model, we generally<br />
do not know the contact forces acting on the robot, which implies that we cannot
invert the model.</li>
</ul>

<p>Inverse dynamics control is a <em>feedforward</em> control scheme, which is 
distinguished from an <em>open loop</em> control scheme in that the latter does
not use a mathematical model of the system.</p>

<h2 id="error-feedback-control">Error feedback control</h2>

<p>Error feedback control is a simple alternative that uses the error signal
to determine controls. Error feedback control requires no mathematical
model of the system, which is a double edged sword: error feedback control
does not anticipate the system’s behavior (if there is no error, no controls
are applied).</p>

<p>The main challenges with error feedback control are (1) setting the rate
at which error is corrected (this process is called <em>tuning controller gains</em>)
and (2) ensuring that there is little lag from changes in the system
state to actuation.</p>

<p>The latter <em>control lag</em> problem can occur because the sensing device has
low bandwidth relative to the speed with which the robot can move or because
filtering (by averaging) is necessary to combat sensory noise. Some plumbing
systems can exhibit significant control lag, for example: water temperature
may lag five to ten seconds behind adjustments to the taps.</p>

<h3 id="proportional-control">Proportional control</h3>

<p>One of the simplest error feedback controllers is the <em>proportional controller</em>, which applies the control signal proportionally to the error signal. The
cruise control system in many cars uses proportional control (also called “P control”): the throttle is applied proportionally to the difference between the current speed and the set speed.</p>

<p>The control for a P-controller is computed using the following function.</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
u = k_p (x_{\textrm{des}} - x)
\end{equation}</p>

<p>\(u\) is the control, \(x_{\textrm{des}}\) is the desired state, and
\(x\) is the system state. \(k_p \ge 0\) is known as the “proportional
gain” or “P gain”.</p>

<h3 id="proportional-derivative-control">Proportional-derivative control</h3>
<p>If many cars operated using cruise control were to suddenly begin climbing a large hill, the speed will drop precipitously, causing the accelerator to be
applied abruptly. Alternatively, the accelerator may be applied as the car is
at the top of a steep grade, causing the car to greatly exceed the desired
speed.</p>

<p>A <em>derivative</em> controller can help solve this problem by accounting for the
rate at which error is changing: control is modified depending on whether
error is increasing or decreasing.</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
u = k_d (\dot{x}_{\textrm{des}} - \dot{x})
\end{equation}</p>

<p>As in the case above, \(k_d \ge 0\) is the “derivative gain” or “D gain”.
It is generally the case that proportional and derivative control are combined
to make a “proportional-derivative” or “PD controller”. This controller is
represented by the equation below:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
u = k_p (x_{\textrm{des}} - x) + k_d (\dot{x}_{\textrm{des}} - \dot{x})
\end{equation}</p>

<p>In the cruise control example, adding derivative control would add <em>more</em> throttle (compared to just a proportional control)
if the car is decelerating when it is below speed and would decrease (or would limit the increase) the amount of throttle if
the car is accelerating when it is above speed.</p>

<h3 id="proportional-integrative-derivative-control">Proportional-integrative-derivative control</h3>

<p>PD control is not proficient at addressing <em>steady state error</em>, which (informally) is error that remains after the system’s behavior has settled. Steady
state error is relevant for only fixed reference signals. A PD controller is 
often unable to eliminate steady state error without excessively large gains.</p>

<p>Continuing with our cruise control example, imagine that our 
car is driving along the highway while towing a large trailor. The cruise
control will stay at some speed \(y\) below the set speed. If the speed
falls below \(y\), the positional error will be sufficiently large such 
that the proportional control component can increase the speed back to \(y\).
The combination of the proportional gain and positional error are insufficient to further decrease error for speeds above \(y\).</p>

<p>Steady state error can be eliminated using even a small gain by accumulating 
(integrating) the error over time. This <em>integrative</em> term results in a
proportional-integrative-derivative (PID) controller.</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
u = k_p (x_{\textrm{des}} - x) + k_d (\dot{x}_{\textrm{des}} - \dot{x}) + k_i \int_{t_0}^{t_c} (x_{\textrm{des}}(t) - x(t))\textrm{ d}t
\end{equation}</p>

<p>where \(t_0\) and \(t_c\) are the initial and current system times,
respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages of PID control</strong> are that the controller can saturate the 
actuators when error is not reduced, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_windup">integral windup</a>- which causes the integral term to rapidly accumulate 
when the setpoint is changed- can occur, and another \(k\) term must be
tuned.</p>

<h3 id="pidd-control">PIDD control</h3>

<p>PIDD or PID\(^2\) control, which incorporates a second derivative, is
not commonly used in robotics applications: few sensors are able to provide
clean acceleration signals.</p>

<h2 id="decentralized-control">Decentralized control</h2>

<p>PD and PID schemes are commonly used to control robots, in which case a
separate controller is applied at each joint: \(2n\) or \(3n\) gains
must then be tuned. This is known as <em>decentralized control</em>, because each joint
is controlled as if it is independent of the others. A torque applied to
one joint creates dynamic effects on the other joints; these dynamic effects
are treated as disturbances to be eliminated. A centralized control scheme
(like inverse dynamics control) computes controls for each joint 
simultaneously and anticipating effects.</p>

<h2 id="combining-feedforward-and-feedback-control">Combining feedforward and feedback control</h2>

<p>The best of both worlds is a hybrid control scheme that combines the
best aspects of feedforward and feedback control. Two options are to
sum the outputs from the two control schemes and feed the output from the<br />
error feedback controller into the feedforward controller; only the latter
is truly a centralized controller.</p>

<p>Inverse dynamics is the most obvious option for feedforward control. Another
possibility for feedforward control is use a gravity compensation block.</p>

<h2 id="stability-of-a-control-system">Stability of a control system</h2>

<p><a href="../dynamical-systems">We have already looked at stability of dynamical systems</a>. Simplifying the issue, there we sought to find whether a dynamical system
would converge to an equilibrium point from points in the neighborhood of the
equilibrium point. For controlled systems (like robots), we seek guarantees 
that applying the controller to the system will result in bounded errors
(recall the definition of the error signal above), <em>even if the uncontrolled 
system is unstable</em>.</p>

<p>For example, if a controller causes a system’s error to be describable by the linear 
differential equation</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\dot{\mathbf{e}} = -\mathbf{K}\mathbf{e}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>where \(\mathbf{K} \in \mathbb{R}^n\), then the controlled system is stable
if all real eigenvalue components of \(-\mathbf{K}\) are negative (and
marginally stable if all real eigenvalue components are non-positive).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the combined differential equations of the plant and the 
controller are usually nonlinear and not generally amenable to such simple
analysis. Lyapunov stability analysis is often the go-to approach.</p>
